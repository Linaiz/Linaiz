# Hi, I'm Paulina 👋
**`Software and Game Developer`**

I am passionate about creating things and solving problems. I like to think that's what makes me a great programmer - I really enjoy it! 

- 🎓I've just graduated from my Master's Degree in Computer Science, with a final grade of 19/20 on my thesis.
- 🎮I like developing video games in my free time. I have been doing that as a coordinator at [GameDev Técnico](https://gamedev.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/) for 4 years now.
- 👩‍💻I am currently looking to join an interesting project and kickstart my professional career.
